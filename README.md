This is where I will be practicing, having fun with, and learning python.

I became really interested in Python after using it in my Blockchain class so I want to become better at it
using fun little exercises created by me with the occassional problem from a question platofrm (ie hackerrank). 

I also see how important and widely used languages like Python, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails are in our ever evolving world, so by taking it upon myself to learn and staying disciplined and practicing I will be able to contribute to the world and help make it awesome.

tl;dr: Python (and JavaScript) are widely used and cool and I so I am going to take the time out to learn how to use them and have fun while doing it.

# How I am structuring this
Homework: One small assignment created for myself that will incorporate many elements of python
- Homework problems are going to be random problems/ scenarios that pop up in my head, hence why they come with stories/scenarios.
<br>
Small problems: These will consist of small problems that help me to understand CS concepts as well as Python patterns better.
- Small problems are typically going to be random small problems that randomly pop up in my head
<br>
Summary: I am going to recount what I learned each week and what challenges I faced and how I overcame them
